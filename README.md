<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The collar is a project that I'm working on to work and learn on pratical 'home
assistant' without the home part. 


Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have rust installed.

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

This may ask you a number of questions, best to accept the defaults for now,
at the moment the system is going to target x86, but this will be changing
to ARM shortly.

The goal is to have this running on the pi/beagleboard soon.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wmealing/loader.git
```

3. Build the project
```sh
cargo build --release

```

4. Copy target/build/loader to your target system.
